# project-pycno-sizeclass-2022
Repository for data, information, and analyses related to SSWD work from Summer 2022 - looking at immune response in two size classes of _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ exposed to wasting disease.

RNAseq data is from coelomocytes collected between 2022-06-21 (Day 0, pre-treatment) and 2022-07-06 (1-15 days post-treatment). These samples came from our first experiment of the summer.

### Experimental question:    
Does raw tissue inoculum from a wasting _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ cause disaese in small (juvenile) and large (adult) _Pycnopodia helianthoides_?  

### Experimental Set-up:     
#### Stars
**Collection information**:
Large _Pycnpoodia helianthoides_:      
Collected by WDFW dive team at Dallas Bank, 2022-05-27.

Small _Pycnopodia helianthoides_:     
Collected by WDFW dive team at Langley Dock, 2022-06-03.

**Pre-experiment**:      
Stars were held in isolation and quarantined for 14 days to monitor for signs of wasting. Only healthy-appearing stars were used in the experiment post-quarantine and isolation.

**Groups**:
Large _P. helianthoides_ (n) = 30     
Small _P. helianthoides_ (n) = 28

Large exposed (raw tissue homogenate) = 10     
Large exposed (0.22um filtered raw tissue homogenate) = 5           
Large control (heat-killed tissue homogenate) = 15        
Small exposed (raw tissue homogenate) = 9        
Small exposed (0.22um filtered raw tissue homogenate) = 5          
Small control (heat-killed tissue homogenate) = 14
